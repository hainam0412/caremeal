== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does installing the plugin will instantly turn my site https? =
Installing SSL certificate is a server side process and not as straight forward as installing a ready widget and using it instantly. You will have to follow some simple steps to install SSL for your WordPress site. Our plugin acts like a tool to generate and install SSL for your WordPress site. On FREE version of plugin - You should manually go through the SSL certificate installation process following the simple video tutorial. Whereas, the SSL certificates are easily generated by our plugin by running a simple SSL generation form.

= Can I use this plugin for HTTPS redirection only? =
If you already have SSL certificate installed, You can use WP Encryption plugin purely for HTTPS redirection & SSL enforcing purpose.

= Need help with SSL installation for non cPanel site =
Some helpful tutorials for non cPanel based SSL installations can be found on our [DOCS](https://wpencryption.com/docs/?utm_campaign=wpencryption&utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=faqdocs).

= How to install SSL for both www & non-www version of my domain? =
First of all, Please make sure you can access your site with and without www. Otherwise you will be not able to complete domain verification for both www & non-www together. If both are accessible, You will see **"Generate SSL for both www & non-www"** option on SSL install form. Otherwise, this option will be hidden.

= Images/Fonts not loading on HTTPS site after SSL certificate installation - Insecure Content / Mixed Content issue? =
Images on your site might be loading over http:// protocol, please enable "Force HTTPS via Htaccess" feature of WP Encryption. If you have Elementor page builder installed, please go to Elementor > Tools > Replace URL and replace your http:// site url with https://. Make sure you have SSL certificates installed and browser padlock shows certificate as valid before forcing these https measures. If you have too many mixed content errors because of http:// resources loaded in your css, js or external links, We recommend using "Really Simple SSL" plugin along with WP Encryption.

= How do I renew SSL certificate =
You can click on STEP 1 in progress bar or Renew SSL button (which will be enabled during last 30 days of SSL expiry date) and follow the same initial process of SSL certificate generation to renew the certificates.

= What if I failed to renew the SSL certificate =
Your site will start showing as insecure on all major browsers thus forcing the visitors to not visit insecure site.

= Should I go through domain verification again during SSL renewal process =
Completed domain verifications are valid only for 30 days, so you will need to complete domain verification again when renewing SSL certificate in 90 days.

= Do you support Wildcard SSL? =
Wildcard SSL support is included with PRO version

= Do you support SAN SSL certificate =
SAN SSL certificates are not supported at this moment

= Receiving "Too many requests" error =
Let's Encrypt API has rate limits so please try after few hours if you receive this error.

= SSL Certificates renewed but new certs not showing in frontend =
This might happen for non cPanel sites, all you need to do is reboot the server instance once.

= How to revert back to HTTP in case of force HTTPS failure? =
Please follow the revert back instructions given in [support thread - Forced SSL via Htaccess](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/locked-out-after-force-ssl-via-htaccess-method/) and [support thread - Forced SSL via WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/locked-out-unable-to-access-site-after-forcing-https-2/) accordingly.

Feel free to open a ticket in this plugin support form and we will try our best to resolve your issue.

= Should I configure anything for auto renewal of SSL certificates to work after upgrading to PRO version? =
You don't need to configure anything. Once after you upgrade to PRO version and activate PRO plugin on your site, the auto renewal of SSL certificates will start working in background according to 60 days schedule i.e., 30 days prior to SSL certificate expiry date.

== Disclaimer ==

Security is an important subject regarding SSL/TLS certificates, of course. It is obvious that your private key, stored on your web server, should never be accessible from the web. When the plugin created the keys directory for the first time, it will store a .htaccess file in this directory, denying all visitors. Always make sure yourself your keys aren't accessible from the web! We are in no way responsible if your private keys go public. If this does happen, the easiest solution is to check folder permissions on your server and make sure public access is forbidden for root folders. Next, create a new certificate.
